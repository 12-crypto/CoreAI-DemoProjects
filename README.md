# CTPO: Tech Projects

Examples using CTPO (CUDA, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV) as their source container.

CTPO (CUDA, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV) is a powerful environment designed to facilitate machine learning, computer vision and NLP projects. These examples have been adapted from public sources and presented as Jupyter Notebooks to demonstrate the versatility and capabilities of CTPO. Each project leverages different libraries and tools within the CTPO environment to solve domain-specific problems. This collection serves as a practical resource for developers and researchers to explore various machine learning, computer vision and NLP techniques.
